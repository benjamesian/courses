# React - The Complete Guide

A Udemy course instructed by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. I have some existing experience with React, but would like to discover common patterns and considerations that an experienced React developer should know.

I will document my experience as I go through this course in a [journal](./journal.md) so I can easily brush up on what I have learned.
