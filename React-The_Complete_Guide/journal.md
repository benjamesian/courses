# React - The Complete Guide (journal)

## Pre-Course Thoughts

I have sifted through the React documentation several times and gone through the [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) offered at reactjs.org. Asides from this I have attempted to build some small sites using React but often find myself lost in design decisions that I know will only become clearer with experience.

My current understanding of the value of React is:

- page content and it's related functionality can be grouped together with jsx to simplify code organization
- the component model offers great code reusability
- faster page rendering/re-rendering (I'm uncertain of the mechanism behind this)
- backed by a strong and thriving community

Through taking this course I expect to gain experience with a couple toy projects, and to pick up pro-tips from the instructor.

The instructor's introduction to this course highlights the importance of JavaScript in the modern web. React is presented as a tool that empowers devs to build/maintain reactive components quickly. Furthermore, the course will touch on styling practices, AJAX, Redux, React-Router, and more!

1.4: Max highlighted how React components are used in real world websites. I found this to be enlightening and will use this practice when I come across web pages that I am fond of or think are well designed. This emphasized the importance of components and their reusable nature.

1.8: React can be used in multi-page applications to add widgets (these widgets would be ignorant of eachother; needs one ReactDOM.render call per widget). Lately single-page applications have gained popularity as the page only needs to be fetched from the server once.

- explored course outline
- preview of advantages React offers over pure HTML+JS or even jQuery
- I didn't really learn anything new in this section, but I now especially look forward to learning all about styling, testing, and debugging practices in React
