# React - The Complete Guide (journal)

## Pre-Course Thoughts

I have sifted through the React documentation several times and gone through the [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) offered at reactjs.org. Asides from this I have attempted to build some small sites using React but often find myself lost in design decisions that I know will only become clearer with experience.

My current understanding of the value of React is:

- page content and it's related functionality can be grouped together with jsx to simplify code organization
- the component model offers great code reusability
- faster page rendering/re-rendering (I'm uncertain of the mechanism behind this)
- backed by a strong and thriving community

Through taking this course I expect to gain experience with a couple toy projects, and to pick up pro-tips from the instructor.

The instructor's introduction to this course highlights the importance of JavaScript in the modern web. React is presented as a tool that empowers devs to build/maintain reactive components quickly. Furthermore, the course will touch on styling practices, AJAX, Redux, React-Router, and more!
